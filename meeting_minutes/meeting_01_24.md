# Git Rules

* Commit often 
    - Keep data backed up
    - Keep the team up to date
    - Can squash whenever you want
    - Put an end of day commit into the branch that you are working on
* Use rebase instead of merge
    - Can rebase off of any branch. Not just master.
* Pull every time you start working
    - Pull remote master into local master
* Code Reviews
    - Have everyone review code for the first couple of weeks
        + Keeps everyone on same page
    - Get one person on a similar task to take a look
