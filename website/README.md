Drag and drop *image_drop.html* into your browser and you can interact with the 
rest of the web pages through there. 

*image_drop.html* is the main page.

*success.html* is what the user will see when they have successfully uploaded an
image.

*company_stats.html* is what the user will see when they select a specific company.
The graph image is just a placeholder for the meantime.

*company_view.html* is what I have for right now where user's can see all of the 
images.
