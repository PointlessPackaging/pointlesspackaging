This is the source files for the website design. To really run the website, go to 
*PP_APP* and follow those instructions.

# Reference

*main.css* is a compiled *.css* file containing all of the bootstrap classes with 
some modifications that I added. The modifications can be found in *main.scss*.

*style.css* contains classes I created that were **NOT** based on *Bootstrap*.

Drag and drop *image_drop.html* into your browser and you can interact with the 
rest of the web pages through there. 

*image_drop.html* is the main page.

*success.html* is what the user will see when they have successfully uploaded an
image.

*company_stats.html* is what the user will see when they select a specific company.
The graph image is just a placeholder for the meantime.

*company_view.html* is what I have for right now where user's can see all of the 
images.
